Expected content
================

a) Brief explanation of the problem and its serial solution
b) The adopted parallelization strategy
c) The complexity of the ratio processing time over communication time
d) Amdahl's law applied to your problem,
e) Timing diagram comprising data transfer times and processing times
e) Theoretical speedup prediction according to the timing diagram and
critical path analysis
f) - Measured parallel execution times and deduced effective speedup
   & graph containing both the predicted speedup and the speedup
deduced from measurements.
   - for DPS and MPI: speedup for 2, 4, 6, 8 (or more) distributed memory nodes
   - for OpendMP: speedup for 2, 4, 6, 8 (or more) PC cores
   - for CUDA: speedup for multiples of 8, 16 or 32 cores
h) Planning until end of mini-project
i) Conclusions

In order to give this presentation, you clearly need a running
parallel program with measured execution times. Based on our remarks,
you may then improve the parallel program for your final report.

Please send your presentation (.ppt or .pdf file) no later than
Wednesday 18th December evening to petar.pjanic@epfl.ch. In any case,
bring it also with you on a USB stick.

The presentations are in room INF017. The schedule of presentations is attached.
Please verify that your presentation is correctly scheduled.
